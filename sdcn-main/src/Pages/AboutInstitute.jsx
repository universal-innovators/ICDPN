            The high standards of excellence give CBS the phenomenal and
            undeniable edge we are recognized for. And these standards are
            endlessly pushed beyond the horizon. This lays down the foundation
            of our biggest asset: Unrest. At CBS, we are never content. The
            inverse correlation between our satisfaction and our progress is an
            acknowledged and appointed theory at CBS. This is the CBS
            difference. What sets CBS apart from other colleges is our
            recognition that every student is different. At CBS, we strive to
            identify and maintain that difference. We constantly endeavor to
            create opportunities for skill development in different areas of
            interest and to cater to the diverse needs of the students. The fact
            that CBS does not believe in a one-size-fits-all policy is evident in
            its placement process, where companies from as many as fifteen
            sectors, including consulting, insurance, knowledge services, real
            estate, media, investment banking, PR, IT, shipping, and financial
            services recruited students. The curriculum and the college
            atmosphere promote inquisition, innovation, leadership, and team
            spirit. Apart from possessing a clear understanding of the
            fundamentals of management as well as a considerable degree of
            corporate exposure, our students are resourceful, versatile, and
            enthusiastic. It is this marked difference that has helped the
            college set new benchmarks with every placement season.
